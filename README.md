# BasicEngine
A basic rendering engine to learn how it works.

No real plan... so will see where it goes.

Using bare minimum windows code to get a window.

Now have a...
- Rasterizer
- Raytracer
- Wireframe
- DirectX D3D11


Some reminders for me

- DirectX default is clockwise front

- RH cooridnate system
